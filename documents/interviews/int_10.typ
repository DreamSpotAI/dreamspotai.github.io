*Q: _Do you prefer to travel solo or in group?_*\
*A:* Honestly, I prefer traveling with a small group, like two or three friends at most, also because make the overall cost cheaper since we divide the various expenses. \
With that out of the way, I did also solo trip, mainly when my friends couldn't come with me because of work of whatever.

*Q: _Do you like to take initiative and try to make an itinerary?_*\
*A:* Absolutely, in fact I enjoy building an itinerary all by myself. In fact, it's the only reliable way I found to find cheap travel options and also because I don't really like travel agencies, they cost an arm and a leg and provides the usual "prestigious" destinations, with little "free" time to use to view all details of a place.

*Q: _How did you find all of the information you needed?_*\
*A:* Usually I find everything on the Internet, using Google maps for finding interesting places and restaurants, social networks to find travel suggestions and confirm some of my ideas, comparative services like Booking for find cheap accommodations and so on. Although I don't like travel agencies, as I mentioned before, I still like to look what they offer: if something inspires me, then i use it as a good starting point for my researches.

*Q: _Was searching information difficult?_*\
*A:* Yes, searching for travel information was and still is something I find difficult to do, especially because I try to find the cheapest possible offer. Also, I spend hours into digging through blogs that sometimes simply copy the work of another, more popular author.

*Q: _How did you organize the journey?_*\
*A:* Over the year I've developed a precise method to plan everything: firstly I understand what I have to search; food, transport, accommodation and activities, then I use online services to find hotels, cheap typical restaurants and possible places to visit. Lastly, I use social networks and similar to find real travel tips: this is particularly important since I love to visit places less "touristy".

*Q: _How much time did it take?_*\
*A:* It depends, sometimes up to 15 hours if I have a lot of free time, for example during winter holidays, I take some days to organize a 1-week trip, but for summer vacation, when I have a holiday at maximum, I have to plan after work, and sometimes it can require several weeks.

*Q: _Were you satisfied with what you organized?_*\
*A:* Well, sort of. I liked what I organized but making all member of the group agree on something it's really a difficult task to achieve. Also, sometimes I need to speed up my searching phase in order to be able to depart on time.

*Q: _Was it easy to manage and keep track of all the travel tickets, passes and documents?_*\
*A:* Actually, yes, quite easy: I use to create a shared google drive folder and I put everything there. This is also the case when I travel in group: my friends all agree this is the best way to keep track of all of the various documents, so if someone book somethings, the he will put the tickets there.
