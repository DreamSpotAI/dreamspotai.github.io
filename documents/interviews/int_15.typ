*Q: _Have you ever holiday-traveled in the past?_*\
*A:* No, I didn’t travel as much in the past. Actually, I would say I started traveling more frequently, about once a year, around three or four years ago. This change happened because I developed a strong interest in discovering new places and learning about cultures that are different from my own.

*Q: _Do you prefer to travel solo or in group?_*\
*A:* I prefer to travel solo because I have the freedom to do whatever I want, whenever I want, without having to wait for others to agree. Additionally, I feel more relaxed when I’m alone or with just a few people around me. This independence makes the experience much more enjoyable for me.

*Q: _Do you like to take initiative and try to make an itinerary?_*\
*A:* Even though I prefer to travel solo, I dislike making itineraries because researching information feels incredibly boring to me. I often don’t know where to find the right details. Because of this, most of the time I don’t create a fixed itinerary and instead decide what to do on a day-by-day basis during the trip.

*Q: _If you were to make even a small itinerary, How would you find all of the information you need?_*\
*A:* Well, if I have to imagine, I guess I would use Google to search for places near the area where I’ll be staying during my vacation. Alternatively, if I know someone who has already been there, I would ask them directly for recommendations and tips.

*Q: _How did you organize the journey?_*\
*A:*  As I mentioned, I don’t usually make a detailed itinerary. I only book the flights and the hotel where I want to stay. Once I arrive, I ask the locals about interesting places to visit or simply explore on my own. This approach allows me to enjoy a more spontaneous and flexible travel experience.

*Q: _Were you satisfied with what you organized?_*\
*A:* Most of the time, yes, I manage well. However, there was one occasion when I booked a hotel far from the city center. Because of that, I couldn’t ask many people for recommendations, and there wasn’t much to see or do where I was staying. As a result, I ended up doing almost nothing for ten days, which felt like a huge waste of money. I’m certain that if I had planned my trip better and researched more interesting places to visit, I would have had a much better vacation.

*Q: _Was it easy to manage and keep track of all the travel tickets, passes and documents?_*\
*A:* The majority of the time, yes, because of what I said earlier: I book only the flights and the hotels so if I have to buy some tickets for museums of attraction or something like that, I do it the same day. That way, I don’t have to keep track of them since I know I will use them the same day.
