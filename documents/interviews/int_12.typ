*Q: _Have you ever holiday-traveled in the past?_*\
*A:* Yes, a little bit, but never outside Italy and even there I didn't travel much, just a few "popular" cities like Milan and Genoa for example, mainly because I don't particularly like going outside of national border. Maybe I can consider visiting some cities in EU member states, but I don't like it very much.

*Q: _Do you prefer to travel solo or in group?_*\
*A:* Honestly it doesn't make much of a difference, both situations have advantages and disadvantages: traveling alone makes the overall travel cheaper and you can take as much time as you need to visit what you want to visit, while group traveling make the experience certainly funnier and less boring, but that also means to make everyone agree and find an accommodation that actually has enough space for everyone. Also the schedule can be a little messy and you could end with month of preparation for just a few days spent together. \
Personally I never did travels with my friends tho, only with my family and alone.

*Q: _About the travels you did, did you organized all by yourself?\*_*\
*A:* Generally no: mainly when I traveled alone, without my family, like that time I went to Milan for example. I tried my best to setup everything but I wasn't particularly satisfied with what I end up with, I'm not really good into that sort of things, although I must say: if you want to spend the less amount of money possible there are not a lot of alternatives. \
On the other hand, when I travel with my family we usually do the whole thing together.

*Q: _How did you find all of the information you needed?_*\
*A:* Mainly using specialized search engines, like Google maps for searching interesting things to view, Trivago for hotels and Trainline for trains and public transport services. One big error I did was not searching for opinions about the various places: I trusted what I read on Google maps but sometimes reviews are simply fake or they don't reflect the current situation.

*Q: _Was searching information difficult?_*\
*A:* Not really, maybe because I did only a superficial kind of research as maybe you could have understood. The real problem was time: search engines can compare prices but finding the right place that is close enough to an attraction and a public transport station it's something that requires time in order to be done properly.

*Q: _How did you organize the journey?_*\
*A:* I just simply read on the Internet about some special events programmed for the current year and then started using search engines and similar to find the best accommodation, the cheapest train tickets and the best deal for the event. Next I started better organizing the various possibilities by checking if I could use the occasion to also visit other point of interest in the area.

*Q: _How much time did it take?_*\
*A:* Quite a bit, mainly because of the mentioned optimization process, not really for the research itself tho.

*Q: _Were you satisfied with what you organized?_*\
*A:* As I mentioned before, not really: I later found out that if I waited just another week I would surely got a better deal: in fact, I would have saved quite a bit of money because of a special offer reserved to costumer that would have travel to Milan to check out a particular event.

*Q: _Was it easy to manage and keep track of all the travel tickets, passes and documents?_*\
*A:* Yes, but I think because my travel have always been short so I never had a lot of documents. Even with I traveled with my family: we simply agreed on taking our own documents and bookings.
