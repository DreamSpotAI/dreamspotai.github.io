*Q: _Have you ever holiday-traveled in the past?_*\
*A:* Yes a lot, my parents bought a motorhome before I was born and we used it to travel every summer for as long as 4 weeks in a row. After the 2021 pandemic, however, me and my family did less and less trips, therefore I started to travel with my friends or my girlfriend.

*Q: _Do you prefer to travel solo or in group?_*\
*A:* I always travel in group because I don't feel so confident in solo traveling yet. In addition, I do prefer being in company during a travel. This week I will fly to Japan and it will be the first flight in which I will be completely alone, however a friend of mine is waiting for me there and we'll visit the country together.

*Q: _Do you like to take initiative and try to make an itinerary?_*\
*A:* Yes, definitively. I prefer to be aware of how much I will spend, what I will visit and what the activities will be. In fact, I organized all of my travels with a little help from some of my friends.

*Q: _How did you find all of the information you needed?_*\
*A:* Mainly on the internet and forums, sometimes also asking parents or friends who have been there in the past. My friends, instead, use to search for information on social networks.

*Q: _Was searching information difficult?_*\
*A:* Yes, both looking for attractive places and getting everyone to agree on the same thing. Sometimes we preferred to ask locals what are the main point of interests around.

*Q: _How did you organize the journey?_*\
*A:* We always used Discord, rarely we met physically. All of us, or at least some of us, discussed about flights, accommodations etc. sharing our screen while searching on the internet.

*Q: _How much time did it take?_*\
*A:* It took quite a lot for every travel I did, especially because we always wanted to spend the minimum amount of money possible by, for example, buying flight tickets months in advance. Even though me and my friends did not meet very often for preparing the travel, we spent several days in order to buy tickets, book accommodations and set up itineraries.

*Q: _Were you satisfied with what you organized?_*\
*A:* Yes, quite satisfied. Although getting everyone to agree was pretty difficult, I liked what we visited both in Malaga and in Pola (Croatia).

*Q: _Was it easy to manage and keep track of all the travel tickets, passes and documents?_* \
Actually no, it was a mess: we use several different services in order to do the bookings and buy the various tickets, so we didn't have a single account with all of the documents. At the end, we sent everything in our WhatsApp group: fortunately the app has a "pin-messages" feature, but we definitely needed to setup the thing better.
