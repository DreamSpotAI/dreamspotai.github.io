*Q: _Have you ever holiday-traveled in the past?_*\
*A:* I have taken many group trips over the years. For example, my group and I went on a two-week coast-to-coast bus tour across the United States a few years ago — a real marathon. More recently, we completed a highly optimized ten-day tour of Egypt, designed to see the main sights without wasting time on transfers.

*Q: _Do you prefer to travel solo or in group?_*\
*A:* Having traveled extensively in the past, I have noticed that traveling in groups, with proper planning, allows for cost sharing and itinerary optimization. For example, the last time I tried traveling alone, I wasted a lot of time just for deciding where to eat!

*Q: _Do you like to take initiative and try to make an itinerary?_*\
*A:* Indeed, I’m not the only one in my group who likes to take initiative. We all actively participate and collaborate to plan our journey as best as we can. By sharing responsibilities and using collaborative tools, we ensure that everyone’s input is valued and the trip runs smoothly.

*Q: _How do your group find all of the information needed?_*\
*A:* We usually prefer to use Google for information searches, focusing especially on reviews and blogs that we consider reliable, even it takes quite some time to do so.

*Q: _How did your group organize the journey?_*\
*A:* We immediately divide the work: when I draft the itinerary, I assign each person a 'theme.' For example, one person takes on the responsibility of understanding how trains and planes work, another has to find a decent and centrally located hostel, and I handle the opening hours and costs of museums and attractions. Essentially, everyone becomes the expert on a specific aspect.

*Q: _How much time did it take?_*\
*A:* For the actual research of all the information needed for a standard one-week to ten-day trip, considering that two or three of us do it, I would say we spend at most 5 or 6 half-days spread over a week. That's a reasonable amount of time, but I'd definitely prefer to spend less: the less time spent searching, the more time gained for traveling!

*Q: _Were you satisfied with what they organized?_*\
*A:* Most of the time, yes, I am satisfied because the main goal is achieved. The secret is that we don’t seek perfection, but efficiency. The group provides me with the basic information: 'This train leaves at this time' or 'This hostel is central and costs so much.' I take those details and fit them into my framework. Of course, there have been minor setbacks. I remember in Spain, someone found a very cheap local bus, but it made us lose three hours due to an unnecessary detour.

*Q: _Was it easy to manage and keep track of all the travel tickets, passes and documents?_*\
*A:* Much less difficult than one might think. For all our group trips, we solved it right away with a shared cloud folder (like Google Drive, to be clear) where we save everything in PDF format. Every group member is given access. The rule is that each person is ultimately responsible for their own plane ticket and visa (if needed), but all passes, museum entries bought as a group, and hostel reservations go into that shared folder.
