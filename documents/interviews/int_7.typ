*Q: _Have you ever holiday-traveled in the past?_*\
*A:* Well, it really depends on what you mean with "past". Before starting high school I actually traveled quite a bit with my family for vacations purposes. I remember traveling abroad to France (Paris and Disneyland specifically) and Austria, but also visiting a lot of cities in Italy, for example Catania, Rome and Genoa. After that I didn't travel a lot to be honest, just some small trips in Naples and Trieste.

*Q: _Do you prefer to travel solo or in group?_*\
*A:* Honestly, it's a bit complicated to answer because I never really travel alone or with friends, just with my parents and my sister. If I must answer, I would probably say that I would enjoy living a small journey with some of my closest friends, it could be a very particular experience. On the other hand, I think I wouldn't particularly enjoy a solo trip, even if organized in the smallest details, I think it would lack of one very important thing: people you could live the moment with, without them, I personally think that trip would be pretty boring, even if it's a short vacation.

*Q: _Would you like to take initiative and try to make an itinerary?_*\
*A:* Honestly, not really: the burden of finding websites and put together dates, bookings and whatever else it's just not something for me. I would 100% ask someone to do the itinerary and all of the bookings for me, even if this would mean paying a small commission and not travel with the cheapest option.

*Q: _When your mum organized a trip by herself, how did she exactly achieve that?\*_*\
*A:* Mainly by surfing the web: first she searched for some location we never visited and then she started finding museums, hiking routes, tourists attractions and panoramic points. If successful, then she proceeded with finding an appropriate hotel in which we could rest.

She didn't particularly enjoy organizing trips, mainly because she don't particularly like to surf the internet, but she for sure managed to do a fantastic work every time. //Potential reason why adults could be a good target. Young adults have no problem surfing a lot of websites, but adults could not particularly like to surf the web

*Q: _Why do not you like to take initiative?_*\
*A:* As I mentioned before, it's just something that is not for me. It's not really because it's difficult to find information, especially nowadays there is a plethora of websites that offer all kinds of comparative services, for like hotels, apartments, flight and so on.

One thing I can think about could be difficult to do is searching for valid places to visit, mainly because the internet is full of tourist traps and articles made just to squeeze a little bit more of money from tourists. Even so, there are some trustable YouTube content creators specialized in travel-related content that can easily help you finding what you really need to pay a visit to: at the end it's really a matter of doing the right researches. I personally think it's neither a matter of time needed: this obviously depends on the duration of the trip and the number of person that have to agree on the same thing, but it's something easily solvable by allocating the appropriate time.

*Q: _About the travels you did in the past, was it easy to manage and keep track of all the travel tickets, passes and documents?_*\
*A:* I must say in the past it was quite a task: especially back when I was a child I remember my parents always bring a folder with all of the various documents and bookings with us, mainly because digital documents were not really seen with something that had the same value as a printed piece of paper.

Fortunately, this is no longer the case and a growing number of hotels, museums and tourist attractions in general are now accepting digital documents as a form of proving the possession of a booking or similar.
